> Deep Relaxation is relaxing and reassuring. Dr Gibbons maintains a very professional manner throughout the session, she makes you feel calm and at ease. The consultation lasts for about an hour and a half, however the time flies by and when finished itâ€™s amazing to realise how much time has passed so comfortably. Since my consultation I have noticed a huge increase in my energy and a lift in my mood. I enjoy listening to the meditation everyday and can feel the benefits with immediate effect. I have struggled with stomach issues linked to anxiety for years and since the consultation I have not experienced any problems which would usually leave me crippled with pain and unable to move. 
> This really is an innovative and intelligent way to help find calm and clarity - no problem is too big or too small. I think that if everyone experienced Deep Relaxation the world would be a much happier, lighter place.
