> I've suffered with tinnitus and poor hearing for years, and was sceptical that Rapid Transformation Therapy could help, but it really did. Dr Gibbons was reassuring throughout the session, and helped me&mdash;under hypnosis&mdash;come to and understanding of why I had specifically developed tinnitus. This was really suprising, but in that moment I knew that I could choose not have tinnitus any longer. The ringing has gone, and my hearing has improved markedly.
