Have you ever felt like you have the weight of the world on your shoulders? Do you feel anxious? Is your energy low? Are you struggling with a medical condition? Is anger or aggression something you are trying to manage but just donâ€™t quite know how to shake it off? Do you struggle with low self-esteem and lack confidence? Is there something holding you back? 

Whatever your concerns are, whether big or small, hypnotherapy can help. My name is Rebekah, I am a doctor and I have been trained in a particular form of hypnotherapy called Rapid Transformational Therapy (RTT). RTT is particularly beneficial as it incorporates elements of Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP), Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) and other forms of psychotherapy whilst in a hypnotherapeutic state.
