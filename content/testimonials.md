> Deep Relaxation is relaxing and reassuring. Dr Gibbons maintains a very 
> professional manner throughout the session, she makes you feel calm and at 
> ease. The consultation lasts for about an hour and a half, however the time
> flies by and when finished itâ€™s amazing to realise how much time has passed
> so comfortably. Since my consultation I have noticed a huge increase in my
> energy and a lift in my mood. I enjoy listening to the meditation everyday
> and can feel the benefits with immediate effect. I have struggled with 
> stomach issues linked to anxiety for years and since the consultation I have
> not experienced any problems which would usually leave me crippled with pain
> and unable to move.
>
> This really is an innovative and intelligent way to help find calm and 
> clarity -- no problem is too big or too small. I think that if everyone
> experienced Deep Relaxation the world would be a much happier, lighter place.

> I've suffered with tinnitus and poor hearing for years, and was sceptical 
> that Rapid Transformation Therapy could help, but it really did. Dr Gibbons
> was reassuring throughout the session, and helped me--under hypnosis--come to
> and understanding of why I had specifically developed tinnitus. This was 
> really surprising, but in that moment I knew that I could choose not have
> tinnitus any longer. The ringing has gone, and my hearing has improved 
> markedly.
