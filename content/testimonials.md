# Testimonials

> Hypnotherapy is relaxing and reassuring. Dr Gibbons maintains a very professional manner throughout the session, she makes you feel calm and at ease. The consultation lasts for about an hour and a half, however the time flies by and when finished it’s amazing to realise how much time has passed so comfortably. Since my consultation I have noticed a huge increase in my energy and a lift in my mood. I enjoy listening to the meditation everyday and can feel the benefits with immediate effect. I have struggled with stomach issues linked to anxiety for years and since the consultation I have not experienced any problems which would usually leave me crippled with pain and unable to move.

> This really is an innovative and intelligent way to help find calm and clarity -- no problem is too big or too small. I think that if everyone experienced hypnotherapy the world would be a much happier, lighter place.

> I've suffered with tinnitus and poor hearing for years, and was sceptical that Rapid Transformation Therapy could help, but it really did. Dr Gibbons was reassuring throughout the session, and helped me--under hypnosis--come to an understanding of why I had specifically developed tinnitus. This was really surprising, but in that moment I knew that I could choose not have tinnitus any longer. The ringing has gone, and my hearing has improved markedly.

> I saw Rebekah for a long term issue I had of suffering with IBS.  I knew she was the right person to speak to as her manner is very calm and reassuring. Following on from the session within a week I noticed my symptoms improve.  It was strange to think that could happen so quickly.  I don't get much bloating or pain and although I do get a flare up now and again it's so mild in comparison to what it was like before. I know the more I address underlying emotional issues the more my health is improving.  I highly recommend her.

> Dr. Rebekah Gibbons successfully permanently achieved in 2 hours using Rapid Transformational Therapy what many of hours of psychotherapy over 17 months did not achieve; knowledge, truth, clarity, understanding, acceptance, resolution, dismissal and eradication of the problem issues, calmness, stability, confidence, integration, wholeness and happiness.

> With RTT, Rebekah, gently, compassionately, astutely and intelligently guided me to being totally free of an issue that had been adversely affecting me for 55 years.
>
> In addition, unbeknown to Rebekah, I suffered from PTSD for 25 years following surgery that nearly killed me and caused me physical health problems for 25 years... and which caused me an instantaneous, extreme, unconscious, adverse reactions to doctors, who were my deepest fear and conflict. I had many hours of counselling for my PTSD reaction to doctors, as I needed surgery that I was never able to get. During the RTT session with Rebekah, something happened, and due to Rebekah being a genuine, caring, assuring, supportive and empathic person, my brain ‘made the decision to trust’ Rebekah as a doctor. As a result, my whole mind set has shifted – I am finally healed of the PTSD relating to my fear of doctors! Thanks to Rebekah, I am at last free to be myself in front of every doctor for the rest of my life!
