### What to expect during a hypnotherapy session?

During hypnosis you are in complete control and have command of your actions. You are not asleep and are fully aware of what is happening. As a clinical hypnotherapist I am only there to facilitate the therapy, you are the one in control and are being empowered to treat yourself.

Hypnotherapy sends your nervous system into a beautifully relaxed state, turning off your conscious mind and allowing access to your subconscious or emotional mind. It is here that previous beliefs have been laid down, often before the age of seven. These beliefs are often not obvious to the conscious mind, but they can be limiting you. For example; a belief that you are powerless to change outcomes of any given situation due to previously feeling helpless as a young child. As an adult this can lead to procrastination and a feeling of not being in control of your life and can cause you to ‘give up’. During hypnosis your brilliant subconscious mind will take you back to scenes in your earlier life that are connected to the issue that you want to solve. This will give you invaluable information about how and why you started to believe certain things about yourself. It will provide you with the insight and ability to change these unhelpful self-beliefs that are holding you back. I will work with you during the session to facilitate your understanding and transformation to help you formulate changes that you know to be true and beneficial to you. You are the one in control, and only you will do what is right for you.

As part of the hypnotherapy session you will receive a bespoke transformation recording which is personal to you. I recommend listening to the recording for at least 21 days. It is designed with care to help implant and nourish your new self-beliefs in your mind by speaking directly to you and your subconscious mind. By listening to this recording repeatedly, you will embed this therapeutic positive change within you.
