Have you ever felt like you have the weight of the world on your shoulders? Do you feel anxious? Is your energy low? Are you struggling with a medical condition? Is anger or aggression something you are trying to manage but just don’t quite know how to shake it off? Do you struggle with low self-esteem and lack confidence? Is there something holding you back?

Whatever your concerns are, whether big or small, hypnotherapy can help.

My name is Rebekah; I am a medical doctor, Clinical Hypnotherapist, coach, and mentor.

Hypnosis is a beautiful relaxed state where you are fully aware and in control but can access your subconscious / feeling / emotional part of your brain. This enables you to identify the root cause of any particular / self-limiting belief and then free you from this. I incorporate elements of Neuro-Linguistic Prgramming (NLP), Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT), and other forms of psycotherapy during the hypnotherapy session.

### Beliefs are shaped by experiences

Before the age of 7 we have established beliefs based upon human experiences. During childhood we had certain experiences that have impacted the way we now perceive ourselves and the world around us. We might not be aware of these subconscious beliefs as an adult, but we may realise that something is holding us back or limiting us.

During hypnosis I will work with you to help you understand how and why these beliefs were born, allowing you to make sense of them. This enables a space for you to rewrite these limiting beliefts and to create ones that are helpful, relevant, and purposeful for you by accessing your subconscious (your emotional) mind. It allows you to identify the root cause and reason for your issues rapidly allowing you to understand and then free yourself from any self-limiting belief. This transformation allows you to freely live life without the restrictions of a challenging perspective and help rid yourself of negative thought patterns that may have been holding you back.

### Where can hypnotherapy help?

Hypnotherapy can be a helpful for:

* Anxiety
* Lack of confidence
* Low self-esteem
* Depression
* Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
* Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
* Phobias

It is also helpful in building self-assurance, for example with public speaking, perfomance anxiety, interview skills, or exams.

This list is not exhaustive and if in any doubt whether this form of therapy will be useful to yourself please do contact me. When conventional medicine hasn’t been able to help or when a non-pharmacological solution is wanted hypnotherapy can be an extremely useful therapy. It is an effective theraputic option for many conditions as described above and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) have recognised hypnotherapy as a treatment option for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). I personally have seen its benefits in many different illnesses and I hope further research will evidence this.
