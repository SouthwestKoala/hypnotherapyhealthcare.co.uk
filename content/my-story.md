# My story

I am a GP, Rapid Transformational Therapist and a Hypnotherapist. I continue to work as a GP in the NHS in North Cornwall in the Southwest of England. I trained as a doctor at the University of Wales College of Medicine, in Cardiff, and went on to train as a GP in the Southwest of England, initially being based in PlymouthDuring my GP training I had my family of 3 children, and once training was completed I moved to the North coast of Cornwall. For 10 years I was based as a GP working in Boscastle and Tintagel. I have been trained in Rapid Transformational Therapy and Hypnotherapy by Marisa Peer the hypnotherapist who developed RTT. I have recently decided to work more flexibly as a GP in different practices in North Cornwall, whilst providing RTT and Hypnotherapy privately at present. My goal is to develop further research and provide evidence about RTT as an extremely effective treatment option for many illnesses that conventional medicine cannot treat. I would like to see RTT used as an alternative to medication when appropriate, as medication can have side effects including addiction and tolerance. It would be wonderful to offer RTT on the NHS in the future, so watch this space…

I am fortunate to be in a position where I can help people understand and identify why they are unwell and can provide them with a variety of treatment options to help them on their road to recovery but as a GP I started to become frustrated by the limitations of conventional medicine. I knew that a pill wasn’t going to fix the problems many of my patients faced in the long term. Conventional medicine is very useful in treating many areas of ill health, but conventional medicine doesn’t always have the answers. Increasing numbers of patients were struggling with chronic pain, fibromyalgia, depression, anxiety, insomnia, irritable bowel, the list goes on… and despite being given medications and talking therapy on the NHS, most were stuck in a rut and felt that they were not getting a solution to their problems.

We live in a culture that places our wellbeing very low down in the list of priorities. There are a vast number of illnesses that arise due to stress. Some of that stress is caused by previous life events and traumas that have happened to us. Psychotherapies available on the NHS are limited, they take time to work and often do not get to the root cause of the problem. I became acutely aware that patients were not improving by using NHS provisions. I saw that frustration was brewing and ill health was developing because patients were not being provided with the correct tools or resources to understand and be free from their illnesses.

Just when I was despairing and at my wits end I had the fortunate opportunity to meet a GP who had already trained in hypnotherapy and was amazed at the benefits of having hypnosis. This GP told me his story about suffering with Bells palsy. Bells palsy affects the facial muscles on one side of the face, causing disfigurement and difficulty speaking. In his case this didn’t resolve with time or conventional medicine, but resolved during hypnosis and has remained so since his hypnotherapy. This had such an impact on him and he decided to train in hypnotherapy himself, and became an advocate for it.

On meeting this GP at a training event I experienced hypnotherapy myself. After only one short introductory session I felt full of energy but also tranquility and positivity, I had to find out more. This experience in itself transformed the way I thought about health and wellbeing, and since then I have trained as a Hypnotherapist myself. I have since seen how effective it is in treating many issues and illnesses, and have used RTT to treat tics, migraines, IBS, insomnia, tinnitus and PTSD. Please see my testimonials to get a flavour of how well this therapy works.
