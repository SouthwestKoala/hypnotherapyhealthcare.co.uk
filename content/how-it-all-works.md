# The science behind hypnosis

## Fight or flight

You survive on this planet by avoiding emotional and physical pain. Your mind acts in what it believes to be your best interests. To make sure we survive, our brain has been coded to pay far more attention to negative experiences than positive ones. The brain is programmed to be alert to danger and pain. Once the pain or danger have been detected by your brain, your mind and body respond by acting appropriately in order to ensure survival. These actions are based on the thoughts, feelings and beliefs that have been registered from your interpretation of earlier events in your life. The flight or flight response is a protective device that the nervous system makes so that you can be ready to run away from or fight off a danger. If the body detects danger (and this can occur even before the conscious mind registers it) the body’s systems shunt blood to the muscles and brain, moving blood away from the digestive system. When in flight or flight mode you are unable to digest food, you may feel sick or even vomit. Your breathing will increase so that you are taking in more oxygen for the muscles to work at their best. Your adrenaline levels will rise, and your heart will start to race. Your pupils will get larger because your body is trying to see as much as possible. Your body will be shouting at you to either run away or fight to protect yourself from the danger it has detected.

Now depending on what you have experienced before, the brain will be on high alert for anything that resembles a previous threat. For example, if at a young age your parent was fearful of spiders, and screamed running away when you encountered one, your brain would have registered that spiders were dangerous. It will have set up a fight or flight response in case you came across a spider again.

Certain experiences you may not consciously remember, will have created a strong emotion. The subconscious mind will have registered them/ wired them and created a belief that you may not be fully aware of, however this may now cause you to experience panic attacks, painful emotions or anxiety when you encounter certain triggers.

RTT will enable you to understand why you are experiencing a fight or flight response, and you will then be able to transform any unhelpful deep subconscious beliefs.

## In two minds...

The conscious mind analyses, thinks, plans and desires. It is only responsible for 10% of our actions and provides you with logical reasoning. The subconscious mind is responsible for over 90% of our actions. It stores and automatically repeats learned experiences, skills, habits, programmes and beliefs. It is our automatic processing hub and filing system.

RTT provides you with the perfect opportunity to transform unhelpful beliefs by literally taking you deep into your subconscious mind so you can start altering and rewiring anything that is holding you back from fulfilling your true potential.

## How it all works - brainwaves

Our brain is an electrical organ. It is full of electrical currents, called brainwaves. There are four different types of brainwaves; beta, alpha, theta and delta.

When someone is functioning in the beta brainwave state they are alert, engaged and fully focused on a task. When in the alpha brainwave state a person is in a state of active rest, they could be taking a tea break after completing a task. Whilst in the theta brainwave state the brain enters a form of hypnosis we would call daydreaming, when in this state time seems to fly by undetected. This is a creative brainwave state which can lead into a flow of ideas or what we term as ‘having a brainwave’. It is also the brainwave state of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, which is used in hypnosis. The delta brainwave state occurs when we have drifted off into a deep and restful sleep.

The subconscious mind is the theta brainwave state and it is the natural brainwave state for children under seven years old which is the age that our core beliefs are coded, and our map of the world is created. When entering hypnosis you experience REM-rapid eye movement. This accesses the theta brainwave state. Theta brainwaves allow you to gain access to your subconscious mind and limbic brain which is the part of our brain that supports functions like reactions, motivation and behaviour.

## Re-wiring

We cannot battle with our minds, as emotion overrides logic, and you can’t fight against your wiring. However when you understand how and why your mind operates the way it does, then you can start to work with it rather than against it.

When we are vulnerable our brain responds to our vulnerability by providing protection. This protection is formed through the wiring of brain circuits. Neuroplasticity is a relatively recent discovery of how flexible our brain circuits are. Inside the brain our nerve cells send electrical signals to each other, these electrical signals or impulses form pathways. The more the brain uses these pathways the stronger the pathway becomes. Nerve cells that fire together, wire together. When a circuit fires repeatedly, it can become the default setting, automating the response. RTT enables you to access the subconscious and change unhelpful circuits to form helpful connections in your brain quickly. The amazing truth about Neuroplasticity is that thinking differently becomes a choice. With this knowledge you are no longer limited. Instead you can choose to think and believe differently irrespective of past life events. During an RTT session you will give yourself the understanding and the power to reframe your beliefs allowing yourself to let go of anything you want to release. Through accessing your subconscious mind this process happens much quicker than if you were to try to change self-limiting beliefs out of hypnosis. Psychiatrist Dr Bessel Van Der Kolk believes that our challenge is to apply the lessons of neuroplasticity to rewire our brains and reorganise our minds. We can achieve this by getting rid of unhelpful and harmful programmes that have been coded secondary to life’s traumas, and rewire the brain to create helpful, nourishing, positive programmes. RTT is a definite and rapid way of doing just this.
