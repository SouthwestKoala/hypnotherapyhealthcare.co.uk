Marisa Peer, who developed RTT, has written about the rules of the mind. Here are six of the rules, they are extremely useful to know and understand.

## Rules of the mind

1. Every thought and word forms a blueprint that your mind and body work to make a reality. The way you consistently act matches the way you think. Essentially your mind does what it thinks you want it to.
2. Every thought you think causes a physical reaction and an emotional response. ( Chemicals/ hormones are released). You cannot separate mind and body. ‘The Body Keeps the Score’, and many physical illnesses arise from previous traumas, stress, negative thoughts, repetitive patterns, unhelpful habits.
3. Your mind is hardwired to resist what is unfamiliar and to return to what is familiar. So make what is negative and familiar, unfamiliar, and make what is positive and unfamiliar, familiar. Your mind learns by repetition so repeatedly create and form new positive habits to establish helpful beliefs.
4. What you tell yourself and how you talk to yourself forms a belief about who you are. Your mind responds to the pictures you create in your head and the words you tell yourself. The more vivid the picture, the more powerful the response. The more specific, detailed and dynamic the words, the more powerful the response. You can change these, but your habitual words and thoughts become your reality. Make sure these pictures and words are positive, powerful and vivid.
5. Your mind does not care if what you tell it is good, bad, true, false, healthy, unhealthy, right or wrong. It accepts and acts on your words regardless. In a battle between emotion and logic, emotion will always win.
6. You make your beliefs, then your beliefs make you and your reality. What your present to your mind, your mind will present back to you. Whatever you focus on, you get more of.
