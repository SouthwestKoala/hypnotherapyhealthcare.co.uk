# What is hypnotherapy?

Have you ever felt like you have the weight of the world on your shoulders? Do you feel anxious? Is your energy low? Are you struggling with a medical condition? Is anger or aggression something you are trying to manage but just don’t quite know how to shake it off? Do you struggle with low self-esteem and lack confidence? Is there something holding you back?

Whatever your concerns are, whether big or small, hypnotherapy can help. 

My name is Rebekah, I am a doctor and I have been trained in a particular form of hypnotherapy called Rapid Transformational Therapy (RTT).

RTT is particularly beneficial as it incorporates elements of Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP), Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) and other forms of psychotherapy whilst in a hypnotherapeutic state.

## Beliefs are shaped by experiences

Before the age of 7 we have established beliefs based upon human experiences. During childhood we had certain experiences that have impacted the way we now perceive ourselves and the world around us. We might not be aware of these subconscious beliefs as an adult, but we may realise that something is holding us back or limiting us.

RTT empowers you to rewrite these limiting beliefs. It gives you the understanding of how and why these beliefs were born gives you permission to make sense of them. RTT gives you the power to create beliefs that are helpful, relevant and purposeful for you by accessing your subconscious (your emotional) mind. RTT allows you to identify the root cause and reason for your issues rapidly allowing you to understand and then free yourself from any self-limiting belief. Often only one session is needed to provide permanent solutions. This transformation allows you to freely live life without the restrictions of a challenging perspective and help rid yourself of negative thought patterns that may have been holding you back.

## What can Rapid Transformational Therapy treat?

RTT can be helpful in treating the following

* Anxiety
* Depression
* Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
* Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
* Phobias
* Addictions
* Tics
* Eating Disorders
* Weight problems

This list is not exhaustive and if in any doubt whether this form of therapy will be useful to yourself please do contact me. When conventional medicine hasn’t been able to help or when a non-pharmacological solution is wanted RTT has proven to be an extremely useful therapy. It is an effective treatment for many conditions as described above and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) have recognised it as a treatment option for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). I personally have seen its benefits in many different illnesses and I am currently in discussions to further research in this.

## What to expect during a RTT consultation?

During RTT you are in complete control and have command of your actions. You are not asleep and are fully aware of what is happening. As a RTT therapist I am only there to facilitate the therapy, you are the one in control and are being empowered to treat yourself.

Hypnotherapy sends your nervous system into a beautifully relaxed state, turning off your conscious mind and allowing access to your subconscious or emotional mind. It is here that previous beliefs have been laid down, often before the age of seven. These beliefs are often not obvious to the conscious mind, but they can be limiting you. For example; a belief that you are powerless to change outcomes of any given situation due to previously feeling helpless as a young child. As an adult this can lead to procrastination and a feeling of not being in control of your life and can cause you to ‘give up’. During RTT your brilliant subconscious mind will take you back to scenes in your earlier life that are connected to the issue that you want to solve. This will give you invaluable information about how and why you started to belief certain things about yourself. It will provide you with the insight and ability to change these unhelpful self-beliefs that are holding you back. I will work with you during the session to facilitate your understanding and transformation to help you formulate changes that you know to be true and beneficial to you. You are the one in control, and only you will see what is right to you. 

As part of the RTT session you will receive a bespoke transformation recording which is personal to you. I recommend listening to the recording for at least 21 days. It is designed with care to help implant and nourish your new self-beliefs in your mind by speaking directly to you and your subconscious mind. By listening to this recording repeatedly, you will embed this therapeutic positive change within you.
